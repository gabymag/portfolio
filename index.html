            Hello My name is Gaby, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Radio and Television Communications from Texas A&M Univeristy - Commerce. I've been working in the radio field since about 2010 where I started as an on-air producer for a local radio station.
By 2012 my radio career transitioned to the corporate side when I was hired by Cumulus Media Networks to work in their traffic department working with sales, national on-air talent, and scripts from nationwide companies. Currently I am still involved with radio ads, by trafficking copy to radio stations via data entry on a platform that generates logs for all the radio stations on the network nation wide.

My web development experience starts with generic copy and pasting HTML layouts for my myspace page back in the 2000's. Lately I have become more familiarized with coding web pages as I plan to transition careers. I have taken community college classes at Collin College in Plano, TX. And now I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Southern Methodist Univeristy.
